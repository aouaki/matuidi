#Shake Your Team

A simple app to gather the latest trends from a given soccer game on Twitter and to fight for the popularity of your team by shaking your phone.

The application uses a websocket with the server since Twitter API cannot be called by a client. The source code for the server end (API to get tweets and votes) used by Shake your Team is in the repo aouaki/verratti.
